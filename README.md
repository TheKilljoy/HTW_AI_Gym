# HTW_AI_Gym
This is a project for a AI course at the HTW Berlin. I'm trying to implement an AI Agent that can play old Atari Games in Open AI Gym using a deep q neural network.

## The Journey

#### Preface
The goal is to create an AI Agent that plays Atari Games.
When this semester started I already knew I wanted to do something like this, but I have never done anything with Neural Networks before,
therefore I needed to learn how to work with them. I already knew the basic theory stuff, but never used something like Keras or Tensorlfow.
So the first things to do were: Getting used to Python (I am still not used to it though), learn how Keras works and what it does.
Before I started searching the webs on how to implement an AI Agent that plays games, I though about genetic algorithms for that, 
I realised soon that there are better ways: Deep Q Nerual Networks. Therefore I started several times throughout this semester to
learn about them.

#### Day One
Today is the 9th of march. I finally got time to start working on this project. It has been a few weeks since I read the last time
about Deep Q NNs, so I started the day with reading again through the impressively good [articles](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419 "First Article of this series") 
of Thomas Simonini. Right now I am at the [third](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-deep-q-learning-lets-play-doom-54d02d8017d8 "Starting to learn about Deep Q NN")
article again and try to understand how it all works. While reading this I'm starting to try to implement one myself into my project.
